# Views News Frontend

### Project Summary
Views News is a social media app (based on Reddit) that allows users to:
* View a list of all articles
* Sort articles by: Age, number of comments, number of likes
* View articles by topic
* View an individual article in more detail
* Like/dislike an article
* View comments for each article
* Post a new comment to an existing article
* Delete a comment that the user has posted
* IN PROGRESS - User profile

This was my first project developing a functional and user-friendly frontend in React. It has a fully responsive design for both mobile and laptops.    

The app uses a default loggged user to remove the need for authentication at this stage.
